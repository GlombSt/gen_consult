# Business Model Canvas

**Version: 1.0**

Structured intent specification + insights-driven refinement for better AI task execution.

## KEY PARTNERS
* LLM Providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (for raw intelligence)
* Cloud infrastructure providers
* Early design partners / power users
* (future) Integration partners (Notion, Google Docs, Slack, IDEs) - future
* Merchant of Record for international sales (Lemon Squeezy)
* (tentative) Community Contributors: Users sharing "Impossible Intents"
* (tentative) RAG Database for vector memory

## KEY ACTIVITIES
* Product development and UX iteration
* User onboarding and education (templates, examples)
* Analyzing intent → output improvement loops
* Research best ways to improve prompts, build vertial specific training and reference data
* Grading & Eval Logic: Developing heuristics to "score" intent clarity/viability
* Intent Parsing & User Guidance: Designing dynamic questions to resolve ambiguity
* Knowledge Curation: Maintaining "Best Practice" libraries (e.g., Security, Legal)
* Consulting service for companies about effective use of language models

## VALUE PROPOSITIONS
* Higher-quality results through comprehensive, low ambiguity, semantical rich specification of work. Drastically reduces hallucination/variance in AI usage
* AI-generated insights that surface missing details and ambiguity
* Lower iteration cost by improving inputs, not patching outputs. Stops the "tweak-test-repeat" loop.
* Reusable, evolving intent "recipes" for recurring tasks
* Industry and Domain specific reference
* Learning loop that captures and reuses improvements over time
* "Quality Gate." Scores intent clarity before execution. Rejects vague inputs frontier models would blindly accept
* "Advisor." Suggests the best way to execute (e.g., "Don't prompt; use an Agent"). Surfaces "unknown unknowns"
* Lifting quality of existing prompts

## CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
* Self-Service SaaS: Automated onboarding
* In-product guidance via insights and scoped chat
* The "Strict Coach": Relationship is corrective, not just compliant. Pushes back on bad inputs
* Templates and examples for common intents
* Support for paid tiers
* Community-Led: Discord/Docs for sharing edge cases

## CUSTOMER SEGMENTS
* People using ChatGPT without guidance but desire for productivity
* AI product and platform owners accountable for consistent model behavior
* Managers describing tasks to be done
* Internal AI enablement / center-of-excellence teams
* Educators and trainers teaching principled AI usage
* Individual AI workflow owners running recurring, high-stakes LLM workflows
* Teams operating shared or automated AI tasks
* Compliance-sensitive teams requiring traceable and auditable AI outputs
* Decision-makers using AI as an input to strategic or operational decisions
* AI systems integrators and consulting agencies delivering AI solutions to clients
* No-code / low-code automation builders embedding AI into workflows
* Domain experts enforcing strict industry or technical constraints

## KEY RESOURCES
* Intent specification intelligence for structuring thoughts
* The "Grading Rubric": Unique logic for what constitutes a "Good Intent"
* Intent insight-generation models and logic
* Frontend web app (React/TypeScript)
* Backend + auth + persistence
* Prompt-generation + execution engine
* Accumulated insight patterns (long-term moat)
* Domain Knowledge Vectors: Databases of industry practices
* Agentic Marketing AI for social and growth

## CHANNELS
* Web application (primary)
* Content marketing (AI productivity, spec-first workflows)
* Communities (builders, prompt/LLM power users)
* Referrals via shared intents / templates
* Dev Communities: Product Hunt, Hacker News, X/Twitter
* Consulting partnerships

## COST STRUCTURE
* LLM API usage (insights + execution)
* Infrastructure and hosting
* Product development and design
* Customer support
* Marketing and distribution
* Security and compliance (as product matures)
* Phase 1 (Variable Risk): High API costs (LLM Inference) as you pay for every "Grade" and "Interview"
* Phase 2 (Stabilized): Costs flatten as heavy users switch to BYOK (paying their own API bills)

## REVENUE STREAMS
* Freemium: limits on intents/executions/insights
* Pro subscription: higher usage + advanced insights
* Team plans: shared intents, collaboration, versioning
* Enterprise: SSO, compliance, audit logs
* Template marketplace revenue (future)
* The "Token Pass" (Launch): Tiered Subscription (e.g., Free: 5 checks/day, Pro: Unlimited). Covers API costs + margin
* The "Power License" (Future): BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) for heavy users. Lower monthly fee, user pays compute
