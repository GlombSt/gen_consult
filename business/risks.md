5. UX Risk: You Are Competing Against Laziness

Your product succeeds only if:
	•	users pause,
	•	reflect,
	•	answer clarifying questions,
	•	and accept being told “this won’t work”.

This is psychologically hard.

Critical UX risk:
The first 30 seconds must feel like:

“This is saving me from embarrassment or rework.”

If it feels like: “Another form to fill” you will lose 80% of users immediately.

Your plan underestimates how aggressively minimal the UX must be.
