# Learning React

Welcome to your first React app! This project is set up with Vite for a fast development experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy). The app will automatically reload when you make changes to your code.

### 3. Start Learning!

- Open `src/App.jsx` to see your main component
- Try editing the text and watch it update in real-time
- Explore the `src` folder to see how everything connects

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the app for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
